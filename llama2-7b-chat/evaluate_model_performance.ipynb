By decomposing complex problems into simpler sub-tasks and incorporating intermediate supervision, unlearnable problems can become learnable. This approach involves feeding a sequence-to-sequence model with an augmented input that includes the decomposed tasks' labels.

It shows that learning in the presence of intermediate supervision is facilitated, making previously unlearnable problems achievable through training on a modified input that concatenates sub-task labels with the original input. This approach ensures that tasks, which are otherwise unlearnable, can be broken down into simpler sub-tasks, leading to successful learning outcomes in sequence-to-sequence models.',\n",

By breaking down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, the model can learn each sub-task independently and then combine them to solve the original problem. This approach has been shown to be effective in various domains, including natural language processing.\\n\\nThe key insight behind this technique is that not all composite problems are inherently unlearnable.
